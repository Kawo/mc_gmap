MC GoogleMap (mc_gmap) is an admin script for use with Minecraft Overviewer (map renderer for Minecraft, 
see http://docs.overviewer.org). Originally it was created to suit the needs of
the administrator of the server where I play but I decided to make it public. Maybe it will
be useful.

It is all free, under GPL license (see COPYING). Please feel free to fork/modify/whatever.

Project News


(02/20/2012)

2.0-dev branch created. Coming back to Overviewer engine.
+ Working to adapt mc_gmap to Overviewer's features.
+ Working to adapt PlayerMarkers Addon to work with multimaps and without avatar.


(02/20/2012)

After one month of testing, 1.5-dev branch is now merged to master.
Still little things to do for a "final" tag, but it is fully functional atm.

Another news, 2.0-dev branch will be created soon. I will try to port mc_gmap to Overviewer engine...in fact, it
was the first engine that this script has used back in november/december 2010, but as the world of my server expanded,
it was to slow to render and pigmap was 400% faster.
The "new" Overviewer seems kickass now : faster, smooth lighting, night lighting, very flexible.
