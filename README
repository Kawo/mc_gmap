MC GoogleMap (mc_gmap) is an admin script for use with Pigmap (map renderer for Minecraft, 
see https://github.com/equalpants/pigmap). Originally it was created to suit the needs of
the administrator of the server where I play but I decided to make it public. Maybe it will
be useful.

It is all free, under GPL license (see COPYING). Please feel free to fork/modify/whatever.

>>>>>>> v1.5-dev

(01/07/2012)

1.4.1 released
+ Pigmap updated to support Minecraft 1.0 blocks

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
- To compile pigmap you will need standard dev tools like make, g++, zlib, libpng or so 
("aptitude install build-essential libpng12-dev" for Debian-like)
- For PNG to JPG convert, ImageMagick is required ("aptitude install imagemagick" for Debian-like)
>>>>>>> v1.5-dev

(06/21/2011)

+ added v1.5-dev branch (this is WIP, do not use in prod atm)


<<<<<<< HEAD
(06/18/2011)

+ 1.4 released on GitHub

=======
1. Create a config file for each map using example.conf in conf directory.
2. Launch the script: bash mc_gmap.sh to show commands that are available.

>>>>>>> v1.5-dev

------


<<<<<<< HEAD
Current functionalities:

- Full or incremental render with Pigmap
- JPG support for faster webmap loading (require ImageMagick package)
- Players's homes printing on webmap (require Essentials for Bukkit)
- Easy to use: just configure one time and then only call the script with "start" arg (you 
can then make beautiful cron job)


Planned functionalities:

- Code optimization (some parts looks crap I know) (wip in v1.5-dev)
- Add "force-jpg" and "force-full-render" option for command line (wip in v1.5-dev)
- Make config file independent so you not have to rewrite it each time this script is updated (wip in v1.5-dev)
- Better MultiVerse support (instead of copying this script for each map) (wip in v1.5-dev)
- Show realtime players's pos on webmap (this will be in two parts: one in this script to 
render on webmap and another who will be a Bukkit plugin that gather players pos)
- Logging function?
- Make a nice interface for the webmap!
