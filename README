MC GoogleMap (mc_gmap) is an admin script for use with Pigmap (map renderer for Minecraft, 
see https://github.com/equalpants/pigmap). Originally it was created to suit the needs of
the administrator of the server where I play but I decided to make it public. Maybe it will
be useful.

It is all free, under GPL license (see COPYING). Please feel free to fork/modify/whatever.

For full install instructions, read https://github.com/kawo/mc_gmap/wiki/Full-Install-Instructions


------


Current functionalities for 1.5beta1:

- Full or incremental render with Pigmap
- JPG support for faster webmap loading (require ImageMagick package)
- Multi maps support (config files are independents)
- Very flexible: you can control each map or whole at once, as you want

Note: homes generation is temporary disabled for beta1.


Planned functionalities (not necessarily for final 1.5) :

- More code optimization
- Add "force-jpg" and "force-full-render" option for command line
- Show realtime players's pos on webmap
- Make a nice interface for the webmap!

QUICK INSTALLATION GUIDE

It is a *NIX script, sorry for Windows guys. It was only tested on the server where I used to play, 
a Debian 6 Squeeze 64bits and my personal dev box (Debian too, of course!). This is a bash script so 
it will run fine in any other distro I think.

Prerequisites:

- To compile pigmap you will need standard dev tools like make, g++, zlib, libpng or so 
("aptitude install build-essential libpng12-dev" for Debian-like)
- For PNG to JPG convert, ImageMagick is required ("aptitude install imagemagick" for Debian-like)

Compiling pigmap:

Untar archive, go to pigmap folder and type "make", it will take only few seconds if you have all 
prerequisites.

Using the script:

1. Create a config file for each map using example.conf in conf directory.
2. Launch the script: bash mc_gmap.sh to show commands that are available.
