MC GoogleMap (mc_gmap) is an admin script for use with Pigmap (map renderer for Minecraft, 
see https://github.com/equalpants/pigmap). Originally it was created to suit the needs of
the administrator of the server where I play but I decided to make it public. Maybe it will
be useful.

It is all free, under GPL license (see COPYING). Please feel free to fork/modify/whatever.

Project News

(02/20/2012)

After one month of testing, 1.5-dev branch is now merged to master.
Still little things to do for a "final" tag, but it is fully functional atm.

Another news, 1.6 branch will be created soon. I will try to port mc_gmap to Overviewer engine...in fact, it
was the first engine that this script has used back in november/december 2010, but as the world of my server expanded,
it was to slow to render and pigmap was 400% faster.
The "new" Overviewer seems kickass now : faster, smooth lighting, night lighting, very flexible.

(01/09/2012)

1.5beta1 released
(see Tags or change current branch)
+ Multi maps support: config files are now independents
+ Code optimization
* Homes generation temporary disabled


------

Current functionalities for 1.5:

- Full or incremental render with Pigmap
- JPG support for faster webmap loading (require ImageMagick package)
- Multi maps support (config files are independents)
- Very flexible: you can control each map or whole at once, as you want

Note: homes generation is temporary disabled.


Planned functionalities :

- More code optimization
- Add "force-jpg" and "force-full-render" option for command line
- Show realtime players's pos on webmap
- Make a nice interface for the webmap!


------

QUICK INSTALLATION GUIDE


- To compile pigmap you will need standard dev tools like make, g++, zlib, libpng or so 
("aptitude install build-essential libpng12-dev" for Debian-like)
- For PNG to JPG convert, ImageMagick is required ("aptitude install imagemagick" for Debian-like)

1. Create a config file for each map using example.conf in conf directory.
2. Launch the script: bash mc_gmap.sh to show commands that are available.
