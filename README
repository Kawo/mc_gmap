MC GoogleMap (mc_gmap) is an admin script for use with Pigmap (map renderer for Minecraft, 
see https://github.com/equalpants/pigmap). Originally it was created to suit the needs of
the administrator of the server where I play but I decided to make it public. Maybe it will
be useful.

It is all free, under GPL license (see COPYING). Please feel free to fork/modify/whatever.

But please keep in mind that, even if I take a look at suggestions made in Issues tab, I
only develops this script according to my administrator's needs. So may be I will add your
idea, may be not :-) (but again, it is GPL so...).

------

Current fonctionalities:

- Full or incremental render with Pigmap
- JPG support for faster webmap loading (require ImageMagick package)
- Players's homes printing on webmap (require Essentials for Bukkit)
- Easy to use: just configure one time and then only call the script with "start" arg (you 
can then make beautiful cron job)

Planned fonctionalities:

- Code optimization (some parts looks crap I know)
- Add "force-jpg" and "force-full-render" option for command line
- Make config file independant so you not have to rewrite it each time this script is updated
- Better MultiVerse support (instead of copying this script for each map)
- Show realtime players's pos on webmap (this will be in two parts: one in this script to 
render on webmap and another who will be a Bukkit plugin that gather players pos)
- Logging function?
- Make a nice interface for the webmap!

------

INSTALLATION

It is a *NIX script, sorry for Windows guys. It was only tested on the server where I used to play, 
a Debian 6 Squeeze 64bits and my personal dev box (Debian too, of course!). This is a bash script so 
it will run fine in any other distro I think.

Prerequisites:

- To compile pigmap you will need standard dev tools like make, g++, zlib, libpng or so 
("aptitude install build-essentials libpng12-dev" for Debian)
- For PNG to JPG convert, ImageMagick is required ("aptitude install imagemagick" for Debian)
- For Players's Homes support on webmap, you have to use Essentials plugin for Bukkit (I do not provide 
any support for that)

Compiling pigmap:

Untar archive, go to pigmap folder and type "make", it will take only few seconds if you have all 
prerequisites.

Using the script:

Just edit top of the mc_gmap.sh file (config part) and call the script with:

bash mc_gmap.sh

It will show you commands that are availables.
