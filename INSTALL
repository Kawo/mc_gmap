It is a *NIX script, sorry for Windows guys. It was only tested on the server where I used to play,
a Debian 6 Squeeze 64bits and my personal dev box (Debian too, of course!). This is a bash script so
it will run fine in any other distro I think.

Prerequisites:

- To compile pigmap you will need standard dev tools like make, g++, zlib, libpng or so
("aptitude install build-essentials libpng12-dev" for Debian)
- For PNG to JPG convert, ImageMagick is required ("aptitude install imagemagick" for Debian)
- For Players's Homes support on webmap, you have to use Essentials plugin for Bukkit (I do not provide
any support for that)

Compiling pigmap:

Untar archive, go to pigmap folder and type "make", it will take only few seconds if you have all
prerequisites.

Using the script:

Just edit top of the mc_gmap.sh file (config part) and call the script with:

bash mc_gmap.sh

It will show you commands that are availables.
