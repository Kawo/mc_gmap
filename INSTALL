INSTALLATION

It is a *NIX script, sorry for Windows guys. It was only tested on the server where I used to play,
a Debian 6 Squeeze 64bits and my personal dev box (Debian too, of course!). This is a bash script so
it will run fine in any other distro I think.

Debian-like instructions

1. Add "deb http://overviewer.org/debian ./" to your /etc/apt/sources.list
2. Then: "aptitude update && aptitude install minecraft-overviewer"
3. Profit.
